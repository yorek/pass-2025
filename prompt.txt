create a new WebApp folder and create a web app, using HTML5, Javascript and JQuery, to query a database of grants. The applications will call the REST endpoint http://localhost:5000/api/GrantSearch?SearchText='<text to be searched>’ and the resulting json is something similar to what provided in dab-sample-result.json The app allows to search for grants related to a provided search text. Make it modern and nice looking. Use Tailwind CSS look and feel.
